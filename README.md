Project Files Using Verilog
## Scalable Multiplexer
A multiplexer (MUX) is a device that can receive multiple input signals and synthesize a single output signal in a recoverable manner for each input signal.
#### Purpose:
To create a Verilog model of a scalable multiplexer
## Traffic Signal Controllers
Traffic signal controllers are electronic devices located at intersections that control the sequence of the lights.
#### Purpose:
To create a Verilog model of a traffic signal controllers.
