## Scalable Multiplexer
A multiplexer (MUX) is a device that can receive multiple input signals and synthesize a single output signal in a recoverable manner for each input signal.
#### Purpose:
To create a Verilog model of a scalable multiplexer
## Traffic Signal Controllers
Traffic signal controllers are electronic devices located at intersections that control the sequence of the lights.
#### Purpose:
A traffic control signal is a device that displays rotating green, amber, and red lights.  These lights direct traffic on when to proceed or when to stop at an intersection.  From a system standpoint a traffic control signal can be represented as a finite state machine(FSM).  A FSM is a model that is used to represent and control execution flow of the traffic control signal.
